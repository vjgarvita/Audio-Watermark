**Overview:**
This project implements an audio watermarking system in MATLAB. Audio watermarking is a technique used to embed information (the watermark) into an audio signal without significantly altering its perceptual quality. This project specifically alters the frequency of the audio slightly, making it still audible to human ears but introducing noise when recorded, thus preventing high-quality unauthorized reproductions.

**Installation:**
Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
Download the project files and place them in your MATLAB working directory.

**Dependencies:**
1. MATLAB (tested with version R2020a)
2. DSP System Toolbox
3. Signal Processing Toolbox
4. Wavelet Toolbox

**Running the Project:**
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
2. Run the audio_watermark.m script to embed a watermark into an audio file.
